Create an AI tool to generate image from text using python programming language, stable diffusion and a github repository
# Text-to-Image Generator

This is a simple AI tool to generate images from text using the Stable Diffusion model.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch
- Transformers
- Diffusers

Install the required libraries using:

```bash
pip install torch torchvision transformers diffusers

# Text-to-Image Generator

This project uses the Hugging Face `diffusers` library and the Stable Diffusion model to generate images from textual descriptions. It is a Python-based implementation that leverages pre-trained AI models for text-to-image generation.

## Features

- Generate high-quality images from textual descriptions using the Stable Diffusion model.
- Save generated images locally in PNG format.
- Supports both CPU and GPU execution (GPU recommended for faster inference).

## Requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher
- PyTorch (`torch`)
- Hugging Face `diffusers` and `transformers` libraries
- CUDA-enabled GPU (optional, but recommended for faster performance)
